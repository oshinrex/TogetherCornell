**Cornell Together** is a program designed to help Cornell students connect with others through exercise. 
It allows a user to input the day and time they would like to go to the gym or another Cornell sports facility, 
and tells the user of other Cornell students who are going to the same location at a similar time as they are. 
Students can then connect to a student and exercise with them, promoting healthy habits and fostering community. 
After exercising, students can give feedback in terms of their partner's timeliness.
